Literally Canvas
================

.. note::

  Looking for a multiuser whiteboard, or want some help building a drawing-based web app? Check out `Browserboard <https://browserboard.com>`_.

Literally Canvas is an extensible, open source (BSD-licensed), HTML5 drawing
widget. Its only dependency is `React.js`_. You can use it to embed drawing
boards in web pages. It's kind of like an extensible MS Paint in JavaScript.
Users can sketch drawings and you can do what you like with the results.
comes with an easy-to-use jQuery plugin.

.. warning::

  Literally Canvas is not maintained. It uses outdated build tools and hasn't
  been improved much in years. Many people still find it useful, but if you
  adopt it, expect to write your own bug fixes.

.. raw:: html

    <div class="my-drawing"></div>

    <script>
      $(document).ready(function() {

          backgroundColor: 'whiteSmoke'
        });
      });
    </script>

Why?
====

* **It's open source.** It's developed by the community for many purposes and
  is free to use and extend.

* **It's a widget, not an application.** Literally Canvas is intended to live
  inside your application in the way that works best for you.

* **It wants to be extended.** There is a public API for adding new shapes and
  tools.

* **It's fast and looks good.** Literally Canvas is optimized to work with
  complex drawings, and it smooths lines naturally to avoid the unsightly line
  angles often seen in simplistic drawing programs.
