Saving to Local Storage
=======================

Literally Canvas can serialize the user's drawing as a Javascript object.
Generally, you probably want to do this in response to
:ref:`the drawingChange event<event_drawingChange>`.

Here's a complete example that saves the drawing to ``localStorage`` so that
when the user refreshes the page, the drawing persists.

.. raw:: html
    :file: _localstorage.html

.. literalinclude:: _localstorage.html
    :language: html
    :emphasize-lines: 7-13
